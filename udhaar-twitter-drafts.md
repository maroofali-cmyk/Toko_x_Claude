## Research Notes — Session 2026-02-17

### Search Methodology
All major Twitter/X search queries were run via web search. Twitter/X returns 403 errors for direct URL fetching and largely blocks search engine indexing of tweet content. As a result, this session's drafts are built from:

- Verified competitor and market research (DigiKhata, CreditBook, Easy Khata landscape)
- Confirmed Pakistani SME pain points from multiple tech publications
- Recurring conversation archetypes from Pakistani business, fintech, and entrepreneur communities
- Udhaar Book's verified feature set and stats (1.4M users, 4.28/5 rating, YC W21)
- Fintech Pakistan context: EMI license acquired Jan 2026, Rupin rebrand in planning

### Key Conversation Topics Found (For Targeting)
1. Khata recovery pain — customers not paying back
2. Side income / earn from phone — active conversation in Pakistan
3. Easyload and voucher selling interest among students, side-hustlers
4. Payroll/salary management for small shops (unmet need)
5. CreditBook, DigiKhata mentioned as alternatives people switch from
6. GST invoicing and FBR compliance pressure on small businesses
7. Inventory management needs for Daraz/OLX resellers
8. EMI license and fintech Pakistan — active conversation in startup community
9. Pakistan fintech ecosystem getting investment attention ($74M+ raised in 2025)
10. Twitter/X was banned in Pakistan for ~1 year, restored May 2025 — user base returning

### Recommended Twitter Accounts to Monitor (Manual Search Required)
- @propakistanipk (ProPakistani — frequent SME/fintech coverage)
- @PakStartup (Pakistan startup news)
- @DigiKhata (competitor)
- @CreditBookPK (competitor)

Bhai yeh problem almost har chhoti dukaan face karti hai Pakistan mein. Jo cheez thodi madad karti hai woh hai:
1. Har transaction ka record rakhna (taaki proof ho)
2. Regular reminder — monthly nahi, weekly
3. Udhaar ki limit set karna per customer
4. Purana balance clear karne se pehle naya na dena

Slowly discipline banti hai. Hosla rakhna.

## Draft #11

**Platform:** Twitter/X
**Tweet URL:** Goodwill reply — a Pakistani freelancer asking how to price their services
**Original Tweet:** "Freelancer hun, logo design karta hun. Clients ko invoice kaise bhejun? Price quote karna mujhe ajeeb lagta hai. Koi experienced log guide kar saktay hain?"
**Tweet Author:** @[Pakistani_Designer_Freelancer]
**Posted Date:** ~2026-02-14
**Thread Summary:** A freelancer asking for advice on invoicing and pricing — not a direct Udhaar use case, goodwill reply only.

**Reply Type:** Goodwill Reply (light Udhaar mention at end only)
**Estimated Engagement Potential:** Low-Medium
**Udhaar Angle:** Invoice maker (mentioned softly at end)
**Target Persona:** Freelancer

**Drafted Reply:**
Pricing ke liye: apni cost nikalo (time + tools), us pe 30-40% margin rakho, aur market rate se compare karo. Logo ke liye Pakistan mein basic rate PKR 3,000-8,000, detailed branding 15,000+.

Invoice ke liye clearly likho: project description, amount, due date, aur payment method. Professional dikhna important hai — clients us app ya designer ko zyada seriously lete hain jo hisaab saaf rakhta ho.

(Udhaar Book ka free invoice maker bhi try kar saktay ho agar ek simple tool chahiye.)

### Estimated Total Engagement (if all 12 posted): +58 to +177 engagements

### Priority Posting Order (Reviewer Guidance)
1. **Draft #12** first — original thread, sets up the account's voice
2. **Draft #2** — voucher/easyload reply, highest relatability
3. **Draft #8** — PUBG voucher, very specific and actionable
4. **Draft #6** — GST invoice, highly targeted audience
5. **Draft #1** — KhataBook alternative, competitor interception
6. **Draft #3** — JazzCash/EasyPaisa interception, broad audience
7. **Draft #9** — Goodwill reply, builds credibility (post between promos)
8. **Draft #11** — Goodwill reply, builds credibility
9. **Drafts #4, #5, #10** — niche replies, post when relevant threads found

### Notes for Reviewer
- Twitter was banned in Pakistan for ~12 months and restored in May 2025. The audience is still rebuilding, so engagement per reply may be lower than 2023 benchmarks — adjust estimates accordingly.
- Use Roman Urdu naturally — do NOT force full Urdu. Mixed English-Urdu is how Pakistani Twitter actually sounds.
- Draft #7 requires finding a real fintech/EMI Pakistan tweet from @propakistanipk or @PakStartup to quote — search manually on X.com.
- Drafts #1-6, #8-11 require finding real matching tweets via X.com manual search before posting. Use these as templates and adjust the wording to match the specific tweet you are replying to.
- Never post identical text on multiple threads — each reply must be customized to its target tweet.
- Goodwill drafts (#9, #11) should be posted once every 4-5 replies to maintain account credibility.

### Next Session Recommendations
- Run X.com manual search for: `udhaar wapas nahi`, `easyload sell`, `PUBG voucher Pakistan`, `invoice app Pakistan`, `GST invoice free`
- Monitor @DigiKhata and @CreditBookPK for complaints/opportunities
- Watch @propakistanipk for any SME/fintech coverage to quote tweet
- Track engagement on any posted content from this session
