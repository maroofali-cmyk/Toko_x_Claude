## Udhaar Book → Rupin Rebrand (January 2026)

### Rebrand Overview

**Current Brand:** Udhaar Book
**New Brand:** Rupin (meaning "Rupee-in")
**Status:** Planning phase
**Announced:** January 14, 2026

### Rebrand Rationale

| Reason | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **EMI License Acquired** | Udhaar Book has obtained an Electronic Money Institution (EMI) license, enabling expanded financial services |
| **Perception Shift** | "Udhaar" (debt/credit) carries negative connotations; "Rupin" (money-in) is aspirational and positive |
| **Market Positioning** | Evolving from "khata app" to "financial super app" to compete with EasyPaisa and JazzCash |
| **Feature Expansion** | Super app capabilities require branding beyond just "credit book" |
| **Global Scalability** | "Rupin" is more internationally recognizable than "Udhaar" |

### Brand Meaning Evolution

**Udhaar Book (2020-2026):**
- Meaning: Credit/debt tracking book (khata)
- Identity: Digital business management app
- Core value: Track udhaar (credit) transactions
- Market position: Pakistan's #1 khata app
- Heritage: 4 years of trust and user loyalty

**Rupin (2026+):**
- Meaning: "Rupee-in" - bringing money into your business
- Identity: Financial empowerment platform
- Core value: Not just tracking money, but growing it
- Market position: EMI-licensed fintech super app
- Vision: Complete financial toolkit for Pakistani SMEs
