# Wallet Activation Plan - Executive Summary

**Created:** January 19, 2026
**Objective:** Activate existing Udhaar Book users to adopt wallet services (organic channels only)

---

## 🎯 THE CHALLENGE

**Current State:**
- 5.7M+ registered Udhaar Book users
- 510K monthly active users (MAU)
- EMI license recently acquired
- Wallet feature ready to launch

**The Problem:**
- 80M+ wallet accounts in Pakistan, but only 4.3% actively use them
- This is an **activation problem**, not an acquisition problem
- Users trust Udhaar Book for khata but need to trust it for holding money

**The Goal:**
- 30-40% wallet activation rate (153K-204K wallets) in 90 days
- 60-70% retention after 90 days
- 8-12 transactions per user per month
- Rs. 800M+ total wallet float

---

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS FROM RESEARCH

### 1. Lead with INCOME, Not Convenience
- Pakistani merchants respond to concrete savings: "Save Rs. 500" > "Save time"
- 42% prefer cash - need financial incentives to change behavior
- Income generation (commissions, discounts) = highest stickiness

### 2. Trust Gap is Real
- 37% fear fraud in digital wallets
- Trust "tracking money" (khata) ≠ Trust "holding money" (wallet)
- EMI license = critical trust multiplier (8.5/10 vs 6/10 trust without)

### 3. WhatsApp is Everything
- 60% of Pakistani merchants check WhatsApp 10+ times/day
- Trust flows through peer networks, not ads
- Screenshot culture = viral potential

### 4. Habit Formation Takes 6+ Months
- IPA study: 3-month incentives FAIL (users drop to zero after)
- Need 90-day program with transition to permanent benefits
- Weekly engagement is critical for habit formation

### 5. Competitor Analysis
- **EasyPaisa:** Utility bill dominance, Rs. 100 sign-up bonus
- **JazzCash:** 122K agent network, 2-3% mobile recharge commission
- **SadaPay:** PKR 1,000 referral (conditional on transactions)
- **Gap:** No competitor integrates khata + wallet + marketplace

## 📊 TOP 3 ACTIVATION TRIGGERS

### 1. Easyload Commission Auto-Spend
**Conversion:** 40-50% of Easyload users
**Psychology:** Money already in wallet (commissions) = no "locking money" fear
**Mechanic:** "You have Rs. 2,500 in wallet. Shop Saddar with extra 2% discount!"

### 2. Exclusive Saddar Discount
**Conversion:** 25-35% of Saddar shoppers
**Psychology:** Concrete savings (Rs. 500) > abstract convenience
**Mechanic:** Two prices shown - Direct: Rs. 10,000 | Wallet: Rs. 9,800

### 3. Peer Referral with Financial Incentive
**Conversion:** 15-25% of invited friends (vs <5% cold marketing)
**Psychology:** "My friend earned Rs. 1,000" = trust transfer + social proof
**Mechanic:** Rs. 200 per referral, Rs. 1,200 for 5 friends, Rs. 5,000 for 20 friends
