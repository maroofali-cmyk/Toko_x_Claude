# Udhaar Book Wallet Activation Plan (Organic Channels Only)

**Date:** January 19, 2026
**Objective:** Activate existing Udhaar Book merchants to adopt wallet services (payments, send & receive money)
**Constraints:** Organic channels only, no paid advertising
**Target:** 1.4M users (510K MAU)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### The Opportunity
- **80M+ wallet accounts exist in Pakistan, but only 4.3% actively use them**
- This is NOT an acquisition problem - it's an **activation problem**
- Udhaar Book has 1.4M trusted users who already manage business finances in-app
- Recent EMI license acquisition = credibility boost to JazzCash/EasyPaisa level
- Multi-use case platform (khata, easyload, Saddar) = natural wallet adoption triggers

### The Strategy
**Lead with INCOME, not convenience.** Pakistani merchants are pragmatic - "Save Rs. 500" beats "Save 5 minutes."

**3-Phase Approach:**
1. **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4):** Commission-first hook - Auto-credit Easyload earnings to wallet, 2% Saddar discount
2. **Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8):** Social proof engine - Referral program, ambassador recruitment, testimonial campaigns
3. **Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12):** Habit formation - 90-day incentive programs, feature expansion, community building

**Expected Results:**
- 30-40% activation rate (420K-560K activated wallets) in 90 days
- 60-70% retention after 90 days
- Rs. 736M+ total wallet float
- 8-12 transactions per user per month

## KEY SUCCESS FACTORS

### 1. Trust is Everything
- EMI license must be mentioned in 80%+ of communications
- Address safety concerns proactively, not reactively
- Show social proof constantly (number of users, transaction volume)

### 2. Income > Convenience
- Every message must include concrete savings (Rs. amounts)
- Lead with "Save Rs. 500" not "Save time"
- Easyload commission auto-credit = highest conversion trigger

### 3. WhatsApp is King
- 60% of activation effort should be WhatsApp-focused
- Personal messages > broadcasts > groups
- Voice notes feel more personal than text

### 4. 90 Days Minimum for Habits
- Don't run 3-month incentive programs - they fail
- Need 6+ months of incentives for habit formation
- Transition to permanent benefits (1% lifetime cashback)

### 5. Network Effects are Critical
- Referral program is NOT optional - it's core strategy
- Ambassadors amplify reach 10X
- Wallet-to-wallet transfers create activation pressure

### 6. Measure Everything
- Daily dashboard reviews
- Weekly optimization meetings
- Monthly strategy reviews
- Be ready to pivot based on data
