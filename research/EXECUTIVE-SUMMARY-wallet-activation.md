# Executive Summary: Pakistani Fintech Wallet Activation Strategies
**Date:** January 16, 2026 | **Focus:** EasyPaisa, JazzCash, SadaPay, NayaPay

---

## The Core Problem

Pakistan has **80+ million mobile wallet accounts** but **only 4.3% of individuals made a digital merchant payment in 2024**.

This is not an acquisition problem. This is an **activation problem**.

---

## Key Finding: Financial Incentives Work Temporarily, Then Fail

**IPA Rigorous Study (816 merchants):**
- **Rs 200 per transaction** incentive → 11% usage increase
- **When incentives ended** → usage dropped back to baseline (ZERO sustained adoption)
- **Information-only campaigns** → DECREASED usage

**Lesson:** One-time or short-term incentives create mercenary users, not sticky behaviors.

## What Actually Works: 7 Proven Patterns

### 1. Income Generation > Cost Savings
**Winners:**
- "Earn 2-3% commission on mobile recharge" (JazzCash/EasyPaisa)
- "Get Rs 200 per customer transaction"

**Losers:**
- "Save time with digital payments"
- "Avoid ATM fees"

**Stat:** 80%+ merchants agree digital payments bring value, but won't act without income incentive.

### 2. Utility Bills = Gateway Drug
**Why it works:**
- Monthly forced engagement
- Builds app familiarity
- Creates habit before asking for merchant payments

**Best in class:** EasyPaisa (dominant utility bill platform)

**Retention boost:** Users who pay 2+ bills/month have 60%+ higher retention

### 3. Agent Networks Beat Pure Digital
**Evidence:**
- JazzCash: 122,000 agents → 19.7M monthly active users
- EasyPaisa: Massive agent network → 50M users
- SadaPay: Digital-only → struggling vs incumbents

**Why:** Pakistan's digital literacy gap requires human intermediaries

### 4. Multi-Use Case Bundling
**Single-use wallet failure:**
- QR-only adoption = 5% of transactions

**Multi-use platform success:**
- Utility bills + mobile top-up + QR + commissions = sustained engagement

**Rule:** Need 3+ use cases for habit formation

### 5. 6+ Month Incentive Duration
**What fails:**
- 3-month campaigns (IPA study showed zero sustained adoption)

**What works:**
- Ongoing commission structures (Udhaar Book: 36% monthly retention)

**Minimum:** 6 months to create behavioral habits

### 6. Merchant-Side > Customer-Side Incentives
**IPA Results:**
- Merchant incentives: 11% transaction increase
- Merchant + Customer incentives: 10% transaction increase

**Why:** Merchants are the bottleneck. They can push customers to adopt.

### 7. Two-Sided Coordination Solutions
**The Problem:**
- 42% merchants: "Customers want cash"
- 18% customers: "Merchants want cash"

**What works:**
- Government mandates (Raast salary payments)
- Large employer partnerships (Pizza Hut with Mastercard QR)
- Geographic market concentration (all shops in one area)

**What doesn't work:**
- One-sided education or incentives

## Top 3 Adoption Barriers

### 1. Perceived Customer/Merchant Cash Preference (42% merchants / 18% customers)
**Solution:** Simultaneous two-sided incentive campaigns

### 2. Fraud Fears (37% merchants / 10% customers)
**Solution:** State Bank authorization messaging, 100% fraud protection guarantees, agent trust transfer

### 3. Transaction Failures (23% of customers experienced)
**Solution:** Obsess over reliability, instant customer support, offline payment options

## What Triggers Merchants to Start Using Wallets

### Crisis/Pain Point Triggers
1. **COVID-19 contactless demand** (Case: Adarsh Spare Parts Shop - business downturn forced adoption)
2. **Customer loss at checkout** ("Lost 60% of customers, integrated wallets, revenue jumped 35% first month")
3. **Competitor pressure** (neighboring shops accepting digital = FOMO)

### Value Recognition Triggers
1. **Access to finance** (USD 57B MSME finance gap - digital history = creditworthiness)
2. **Business growth** (60% of online shoppers prefer wallets over credit cards)
3. **Formalization benefits** (tax compliance, professional image)

### Financial Triggers
1. **Sign-up bonuses** (Rs 100 EasyPaisa, PKR 1,000 SadaPay)
2. **Transaction incentives** (Rs 200 per transaction)
3. **Commission opportunities** (2-3% mobile recharge, 4-5% vouchers)

### Enablement Triggers
1. **Zero-friction onboarding** (2-3 minute setup)
2. **Agent assistance** (122,000 JazzCash agents)
3. **Pre-built integrations** (8 e-commerce plugins)

## Features That Drive Stickiness

| Feature | Frequency | Stickiness Score | Why It Works |
|---------|-----------|------------------|--------------|
| **Easyload commission** | Daily | Very High | Income generation, merchants actively promote |
| **Mobile top-up** | Weekly | Very High | Recurring need |
| **Utility bills** | Monthly | High | Forced engagement, habit formation |
| **Financial tracking** | Weekly | High | Replaces manual khata, tax/inventory needs |
| **Team cards** | Daily (B2B) | Very High | Switching cost, network effect |
| **WhatsApp integration** | Continuous | High | Dominant platform, social proof |
| **Merchant QR payments** | Varies | Low | Cash alternative exists |

**Critical insight:** Income-generating features create highest stickiness because merchants actively promote them.

## Pakistan-Specific Cultural Insights

1. **Trust > Technology** - State Bank authorization matters more than features
2. **WhatsApp = King** - Integration non-negotiable
3. **Cash culture deep** - Position as cash enhancer, not replacement
4. **Income > Convenience** - "Earn Rs 2K/month" beats "Save 5 minutes"
5. **Agent networks = accessibility** - Tier 2/3 cities need human presence

---

## Bottom Line

**The activation gap is Pakistan's fintech opportunity.**

80M accounts exist. Only 4.3% use them for merchant payments. The winners will:

1. Lead with income generation (commissions, cashback)
2. Bundle 3+ use cases (bills, top-ups, payments, commissions)
3. Run 6+ month incentive programs (not 3-month campaigns)
4. Build agent networks (digital literacy gap)
5. Solve coordination problem (two-sided campaigns)
6. Obsess over trust/security messaging (fraud fears)
7. Integrate with WhatsApp (dominant platform)

**For Rupin:** The EMI license + 5.7M+ Udhaar Book users + multi-use case platform = perfect setup to win wallet activation if executed correctly.
