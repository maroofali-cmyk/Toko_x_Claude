# Pakistan Bakery Market & Bakery Supplies Industry Research
## For Saddar.com.pk -- Wholesale E-Commerce Expansion Opportunity
### Research Date: February 18, 2026

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**The Opportunity in 3 Bullets:**
1. Pakistan's bakery market is valued at approximately **US$25 billion (PKR 700+ billion)** in 2025, growing at **6.7% CAGR** through 2031 -- and the bakery *supplies* segment (equipment, tools, ingredients) serving 11,000+ bakeries and a rapidly growing home-baker community is massively underserved online.
2. Only **5-6 niche online stores** currently serve bakery supplies in Pakistan (Bakeware.pk, BakersSupplies.pk, Bakehouse.pk, Cakes.com.pk, BakeAwayPK, BakingItems.com) -- none operate at wholesale scale or with the logistics reach of Saddar.com.pk. This is a clear gap.
3. The **home baking revolution** (driven by women entrepreneurs, TikTok trends like Dubai chocolate, and 70%+ of women entrepreneurs selling online) creates a massive, fast-growing customer segment perfectly aligned with Saddar's wholesale-to-retail model.
