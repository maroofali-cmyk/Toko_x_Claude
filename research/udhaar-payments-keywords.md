3. **"Free IBFT transfer app Pakistan"** — Users looking for zero-fee transfers have limited local options.
4. **"Digital payment for kiryana store"** — Niche audience, very low competition.
5. **"Raast payment app Pakistan"** — Raast is growing but undercovered in fintech content.
6. **"Collect payment via WhatsApp Pakistan"** — WhatsApp-first merchant use-case, almost no content coverage.
