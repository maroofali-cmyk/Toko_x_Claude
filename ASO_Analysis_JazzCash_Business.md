## 8. Legal & Risk Assessment

### ✅ LOW RISK (Safe to Implement)

### ⚠️ MODERATE RISK (Requires Monitoring)

**Frequency of "JazzCash" Mentions:**
- Current recommendation: ~15 mentions in 4000-character description (~1% density)
- Risk: If Play Store flags as "keyword stuffing," reduce to 8-10 mentions
- Mitigation: Use variations ("competitor apps", "other mobile wallets", "traditional payment apps")

### ❌ HIGH RISK (DO NOT DO)

- ❌ Using "JazzCash" in app title (e.g., "Rupin - JazzCash Alternative")
- ❌ Using JazzCash logo or branding anywhere
- ❌ Making false claims about JazzCash
- ❌ Claiming to BE JazzCash or affiliated with them
