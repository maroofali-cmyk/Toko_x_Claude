**Project:** Udhaar Book → Rupin Rebrand
**Focus:** LinkedIn Transformation for B2B Growth & Employer Branding

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive LinkedIn strategy for Rupin's rebrand from Udhaar Book. The strategy focuses on repositioning from a simple "khata app" to Pakistan's first EMI-licensed financial super app, targeting three core audiences: B2B partners (Saddar marketplace suppliers), potential employees (tech talent), and investors/media (credibility building).

**Current State:**

- Underutilized for thought leadership

**Strategic Objectives:**
1. Grow LinkedIn followers from 4,021 to 10,000 within 6 months
2. Establish Rupin as thought leader in Pakistani fintech space
3. Generate 500+ qualified B2B leads for Saddar marketplace suppliers
4. Attract top tech talent for engineering and product roles
5. Build investor and media relationships for future funding rounds

**Key Initiatives:**
- Launch "Rupin Insights" weekly newsletter
- Create educational carousel series on fintech and SME growth
- Implement employee advocacy program
- Run LinkedIn ads targeting B2B decision-makers
- Founder-led thought leadership content

## Part 1: Current State Analysis

### 1.1 Udhaar Book LinkedIn Audit

**Company Page Metrics:**
- **Followers:** 4,021
- **Engagement Rate:** <2% (estimated, based on typical posts)
- **Posting Frequency:** Irregular (1-2 posts per week)
- **Content Mix:** Company updates (60%), job postings (30%), industry news (10%)

**Strengths:**

- $6.12M funding announcement generated significant visibility
- Strong employer branding foundation (team photos, culture posts)
- Professional page design with clear value proposition

**Weaknesses:**
- Low engagement: Posts typically receive 10-30 reactions, 0-5 comments
- Inconsistent posting schedule creates low follower expectations
- Limited thought leadership content
- Minimal founder/leadership visibility
- No newsletter or content series
- Underutilized LinkedIn Articles and carousels
- Low employee advocacy (few employees sharing company content)
- Missing opportunities for B2B lead generation

**Competitor Benchmarking:**

| Company | Followers | Engagement | Content Strategy |
|---------|-----------|------------|------------------|

- Place hashtags in first comment (cleaner look)

**Posting Time Optimization:**
- Best days: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
- Best times: 9-11 AM Pakistan Time

**Technical Issues / App Outages:**
- Proactive communication: Post immediately when aware
- Provide updates every hour
- Apologize sincerely, explain fix timeline
- Follow up when resolved: "We've fixed the issue. Here's what happened and how we're preventing it..."
